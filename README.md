# Your Movie DataBase

  * Build an AngularJS (or Ruby on Rails) application to manage your movie collection.
  * The user should be able to CRUD movies and upload multiple pictures for each of her films.
  * To store the data, you can use local storage mechanisms modern browsers are giving you - use what you're comfortable with!
  * Upon loading, the user should be able to see a visual representation of his/her film library (i.e. utilizing the films' uploaded pictures.)
